# React Native - Eject & Build APK Guide

This guide walks you through ejecting a React Native (Expo-managed) project and building an Android APK using `gradlew`, including all prerequisites like installing the Android SDK, JDK, and setting up the environment.

---

## üì¶ Step 1: Eject from Expo

If you're using Expo, run the following to eject:

```bash
npx expo eject
```

This converts your project into a **bare React Native app**, creating `android/` and `ios/` directories.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è After ejecting, the Expo Go app can no longer run your project. You‚Äôll now use Android Studio or CLI tools.

---

## üíª Step 2: Install Android Development Tools

You need to install the following:

### ‚úÖ Java Development Kit (JDK)

- Download and install [JDK 17 or JDK 11](https://adoptium.net/).
- After installation, set `JAVA_HOME`:

```bash
# macOS/Linux (add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc)
export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/your/jdk
export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH

# Windows (Environment Variables)
JAVA_HOME=C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-17
```

### ‚úÖ Android Studio & SDK

1. Download and install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio).
2. Open Android Studio and go to:
   - **Preferences > Appearance & Behavior > System Settings > Android SDK**
   - Install:
     - **Android SDK Tools**
     - **Android SDK Platform-Tools**
     - **Android SDK Build-Tools**
     - **Android 13 (or latest)**

3. Set the environment variables:

```bash
# macOS/Linux (add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc)
export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Library/Android/sdk
export PATH=$ANDROID_HOME/emulator:$ANDROID_HOME/tools:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools:$PATH

# Windows (Environment Variables)
ANDROID_HOME=C:\Users\<YourName>\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk
```

---

## üß± Step 3: Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Step 4: Build the APK

Navigate to the `android/` directory and run:

```bash
cd android
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

On Windows:

```bash
cd android
gradlew assembleRelease
```

---

## üì¶ APK Output

Your APK will be generated at:

```
android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
```

You can now install it on your device or distribute it.

---

## üß™ Optional: Test on Device

To install the APK on a connected device:

```bash
adb install app-release.apk
```

Ensure USB debugging is enabled and the device is connected via ADB.

---

## üìå Notes

- You may need to update the `android/app/build.gradle` file with your keystore if you plan to publish the APK to the Play Store.
- You can continue using `npx react-native run-android` during development for fast iterations.

---

## ‚úÖ Done!

You have now successfully ejected from Expo and built an Android APK using `gradlew`.
